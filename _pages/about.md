# About Me


I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Dr.Jinghui Chen](https://jinghuichen.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2022. My research interests include trustworthiness and security issues in large language models, safety and privacy issues in image generation models, and interpretation and evaluation of large pre-trained models. I warmly welcome anyone to discuss research works with me!

<em style="color: red;">I am actively seeking full-time research positions and faculty opportunities for 2026. If you are hiring or know of suitable openings, I would love to connect — please feel free to reach out!</em>
